# vLLM CPU Build Configuration
# This file specifies the vLLM version and build parameters for CPU-only builds

# vLLM version to use for CPU builds
# This version has been tested to support:
# 1. CPU inference
# 2. LoRA adapters 
# 3. Constrained decoding with regular expressions (guided_regex/guided_json)
VLLM_VERSION=v0.6.4.post1

# Build configuration
# Set to true to enable AVX512_BF16 optimizations if supported by CPU
VLLM_CPU_AVX512BF16=auto

# Set to true to enable AVX512_VNNI optimizations if supported by CPU  
VLLM_CPU_AVX512VNNI=auto

# KV Cache space for CPU inference (in GB)
VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE=8

# OpenMP thread binding strategy
# auto: bind threads to CPU cores automatically based on NUMA
# all: use all available CPU cores
# <range>: specify CPU core range (e.g., "0-31")
VLLM_CPU_OMP_THREADS_BIND=auto

# Number of CPU cores to reserve for system/framework (when using auto binding)
VLLM_CPU_NUM_OF_RESERVED_CPU=1

# Build cache directory
CACHE_DIR=${HOME}/.cache/granite-io/vllm-cpu

# Version compatibility notes:
# v0.6.4.post1: Confirmed support for CPU inference, LoRA adapters, and guided generation
# v0.6.3.post1: Alternative version with good compatibility
# v0.6.2: Minimum version with reliable CPU support
#
# Newer versions should also work but may require build script updates
# Older versions may have limited CPU support or missing features
