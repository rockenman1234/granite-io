## Version Compatibility

### Selected Version: v0.6.4.post1
After testing multiple versions, v0.6.4.post1 was selected as it provides:
- ✅ Stable CPU inference
- ✅ Full LoRA adapter support
- ✅ Complete constrained decoding (guided_regex, guided_json)
- ✅ Reliable compilation on modern systems

### Alternative Versions Tested:
- v0.6.3.post1: Good compatibility, alternative option
- v0.6.2: Minimum viable version with some limitations

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements:
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- **CPU**: x86_64 with AVX512F instruction set
- **Python**: 3.9 - 3.12
- **Compiler**: GCC 12.3.0+ (recommended)
- **Memory**: 8GB+ RAM for building, 4GB+ for runtime

### Compatibility Check:
```bash
# Quick system check
./scripts/setup-cpu-dev.sh check

# Full compatibility test
./scripts/test-vllm-compatibility.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Setup everything
make -f Makefile.cpu dev-quick

# Or step by step
./scripts/setup-cpu-dev.sh setup
./scripts/setup-cpu-dev.sh build
./scripts/setup-cpu-dev.sh test
```

### Tox Testing:
```bash
# Run CPU unit tests
tox -e vllm-cpu-unit

# Test RAG notebook 
tox -e vllm-cpu-notebooks

# All CPU tests
tox -e vllm-cpu-unit,vllm-cpu-notebooks
```

### CI Integration:
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs on:
- Manual dispatch (with version selection)
- Changes to CPU vLLM scripts
- Weekly schedule for regression testing

## Validation with RAG Notebook

The `notebooks/rag.ipynb` serves as the primary validation test because it exercises all three required features simultaneously:

1. **CPU Inference**: Runs LocalVLLMServer on CPU
2. **LoRA Adapters**: Uses multiple LoRA models:
   - Query rewrite LoRA
   - Citations LoRA  
   - Answerability LoRA
   - Hallucination detection LoRA
   - Certainty LoRA
3. **Constrained Decoding**: Uses `guided_regex` and `guided_json` for:
   - Query rewriting with regex patterns
   - JSON schema-based citation generation
   - Structured hallucination detection output

## Performance Considerations

### Build Performance:
- Initial compilation: 20-60 minutes
- Cached builds: <5 minutes
- ccache integration reduces rebuild times
- Parallel compilation optimized for available cores

### Runtime Performance:
- CPU inference is slower than GPU but suitable for:
  - Development and testing environments
  - CI pipelines
  - Systems without GPU access
  - Small to medium model inference

### Memory Usage:
- Build process: ~8GB peak memory usage
- Runtime: Configurable via `VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE`
- Recommended: 16GB+ for comfortable development

## Caching Strategy

### Build Cache:
- Compiled wheels cached in `~/.cache/granite-io/vllm-cpu/`
- Cache key includes: vLLM version, GCC version, CPU features
- Automatic cache validation before reuse
- GitHub Actions cache integration for CI

### ccache Integration:
- Compiler cache for faster rebuilds
- 5GB cache size limit
- Shared across multiple builds

## Testing Strategy

### Multi-Level Testing:
1. **System Compatibility**: CPU features, compiler versions
2. **Import Testing**: Basic vLLM functionality
3. **Feature Testing**: LoRA, guided generation capabilities
4. **Integration Testing**: Granite IO compatibility
5. **End-to-End Testing**: RAG notebook execution

### Continuous Integration:
- Automated testing on GitHub Actions
- Weekly regression testing
- Manual testing with different vLLM versions
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements:
- ARM64/AArch64 support
- Docker-based build environments
- Pre-built wheel distribution
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Additional notebook compatibility testing

### Maintenance:
- Regular vLLM version compatibility testing
- CI infrastructure monitoring
- Documentation updates
- User feedback integration

## Troubleshooting Support

### Common Issues Covered:
1. AVX512 CPU requirement detection
2. GCC version compatibility
3. Memory constraints during build
4. Import/runtime errors
5. Performance optimization

### Debug Tools:
- Detailed status reporting
- Build log collection
- Compatibility test suite
- Verbose error reporting

## Impact

This implementation enables:
- **Development**: Full local development without GPU requirement
- **CI/CD**: Reliable automated testing in CPU-only environments
- **Accessibility**: Broader developer access to Granite IO features
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation of all three key features
- **Maintenance**: Sustainable long-term CPU support strategy

The solution provides a robust foundation for CPU-only vLLM usage while maintaining feature parity with GPU implementations and ensuring long-term maintainability through automated testing and comprehensive documentation.
