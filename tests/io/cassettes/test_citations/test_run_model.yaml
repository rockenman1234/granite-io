      {\"document_id\": \"2\"}<|end_of_role|>\n<c0> Git Repos and Issue Tracking is
      an IBM-hosted component of the Continuous Delivery service. <c1> All of the
      data that you provide to Git Repos and Issue Tracking, including but not limited
      to source files, issues, pull requests, and project configuration properties,
      is managed securely within Continuous Delivery. <c2> However, Git Repos and
      Issue Tracking supports various mechanisms for exporting, sending, or otherwise
      sharing data to users and third parties. <c3> The ability of Git Repos and Issue
      Tracking to share information is typical of many social coding platforms. <c4>
      However, such sharing might conflict with regulatory controls that apply to
      your business. <c5> After you create a project in Git Repos and Issue Tracking,
      but before you entrust any files, issues, records, or other data with the project,
      review the project settings and change any settings that you deem necessary
      to protect your data. <c6> Settings to review include visibility levels, email
      notifications, integrations, web hooks, access tokens, deploy tokens, and deploy
      keys. <c7> Project visibility levels \n\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking projects
      can have one of the following visibility levels: private, internal, or public.
      <c8> * Private projects are visible only to project members. <c9> This setting
      is the default visibility level for new projects, and is the most secure visibility
      level for your data. <c10> * Internal projects are visible to all users that
      are logged in to IBM Cloud. <c11> * Public projects are visible to anyone. <c12>
      To limit project access to only project members, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.
      <c13> From the project sidebar, click Settings > General. <c14> 2. <c15> On
      the General Settings page, click Visibility > project features > permissions.
      <c16> 3. <c17> Locate the Project visibility setting. <c18> 4. <c19> Select
      Private, if it is not already selected. <c20> 5. <c21> Click Save changes. <c22>
      Project membership \n\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking is a cloud hosted social
      coding environment that is available to all Continuous Delivery users. <c23>
      If you are a Git Repos and Issue Tracking project Maintainer or Owner, you can
      invite any user and group members to the project. <c24> IBM Cloud places no
      restrictions on who you can invite to a project.<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>document

      Repos and Issue Tracking notifies project members by way of email about project
      activities. <c43> These emails typically include customer-owned data that was
      provided to Git Repos and Issue Tracking by users. <c44> For example, if a user
      posts a comment to an issue, Git Repos and Issue Tracking sends an email to
      all subscribers. <c45> The email includes information such as a copy of the
      comment, the user who posted it, and when the comment was posted. <c46> To turn
      off all email notifications for your project, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.
