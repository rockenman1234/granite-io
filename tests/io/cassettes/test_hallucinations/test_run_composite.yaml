      {\"document_id\": \"1\"}<|end_of_role|>\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking is an
      IBM-hosted component of the Continuous Delivery service. All of the data that
      you provide to Git Repos and Issue Tracking, including but not limited to source
      files, issues, pull requests, and project configuration properties, is managed
      securely within Continuous Delivery. However, Git Repos and Issue Tracking supports
      various mechanisms for exporting, sending, or otherwise sharing data to users
      and third parties. The ability of Git Repos and Issue Tracking to share information
      is typical of many social coding platforms. However, such sharing might conflict
      with regulatory controls that apply to your business. After you create a project
      in Git Repos and Issue Tracking, but before you entrust any files, issues, records,
      or other data with the project, review the project settings and change any settings
      that you deem necessary to protect your data. Settings to review include visibility
      levels, email notifications, integrations, web hooks, access tokens, deploy
      tokens, and deploy keys. Project visibility levels \n\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking
      projects can have one of the following visibility levels: private, internal,
      or public. * Private projects are visible only to project members. This setting
      is the default visibility level for new projects, and is the most secure visibility
      level for your data. * Internal projects are visible to all users that are logged
      in to IBM Cloud. * Public projects are visible to anyone. To limit project access
      to only project members, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the project
      sidebar, click Settings > General. 2. On the General Settings page, click Visibility
      > project features > permissions. 3. Locate the Project visibility setting.
      4. Select Private, if it is not already selected. 5. Click Save changes. Project
      membership \n\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking is a cloud hosted social coding
      environment that is available to all Continuous Delivery users. If you are a
      Git Repos and Issue Tracking project Maintainer or Owner, you can invite any
      user and group members to the project. IBM Cloud places no restrictions on who
      you can invite to a project.<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>document {\"document_id\":

      settings \n\nBy default, Git Repos and Issue Tracking notifies project members
      by way of email about project activities. These emails typically include customer-owned
      data that was provided to Git Repos and Issue Tracking by users. For example,
      if a user posts a comment to an issue, Git Repos and Issue Tracking sends an
      email to all subscribers. The email includes information such as a copy of the
      comment, the user who posted it, and when the comment was posted. To turn off
      all email notifications for your project, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

      IBM-hosted component of the Continuous Delivery service. All of the data that
      you provide to Git Repos and Issue Tracking, including but not limited to source
      files, issues, pull requests, and project configuration properties, is managed
      securely within Continuous Delivery. However, Git Repos and Issue Tracking supports
      various mechanisms for exporting, sending, or otherwise sharing data to users
      and third parties. The ability of Git Repos and Issue Tracking to share information
      is typical of many social coding platforms. However, such sharing might conflict
      with regulatory controls that apply to your business. After you create a project
      in Git Repos and Issue Tracking, but before you entrust any files, issues, records,
      or other data with the project, review the project settings and change any settings
      that you deem necessary to protect your data. Settings to review include visibility
      levels, email notifications, integrations, web hooks, access tokens, deploy
      tokens, and deploy keys. Project visibility levels \n\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking
      projects can have one of the following visibility levels: private, internal,
      or public. * Private projects are visible only to project members. This setting
      is the default visibility level for new projects, and is the most secure visibility
      level for your data. * Internal projects are visible to all users that are logged
      in to IBM Cloud. * Public projects are visible to anyone. To limit project access
      to only project members, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the project
      sidebar, click Settings > General. 2. On the General Settings page, click Visibility
      > project features > permissions. 3. Locate the Project visibility setting.
      4. Select Private, if it is not already selected. 5. Click Save changes. Project
      membership \n\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking is a cloud hosted social coding
      environment that is available to all Continuous Delivery users. If you are a
      Git Repos and Issue Tracking project Maintainer or Owner, you can invite any
      user and group members to the project. IBM Cloud places no restrictions on who
      you can invite to a project.<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>document {\"document_id\":

      settings \n\nBy default, Git Repos and Issue Tracking notifies project members
      by way of email about project activities. These emails typically include customer-owned
      data that was provided to Git Repos and Issue Tracking by users. For example,
      if a user posts a comment to an issue, Git Repos and Issue Tracking sends an
      email to all subscribers. The email includes information such as a copy of the
      comment, the user who posted it, and when the comment was posted. To turn off
      all email notifications for your project, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.
