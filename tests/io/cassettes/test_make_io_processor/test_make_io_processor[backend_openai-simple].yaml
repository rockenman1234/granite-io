        I''d be happy to demonstrate chat templates with you. Let''s say we have a
        simple greeting template for the city of \"Wonderland\". Here it is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"greeting\":
        \"Welcome to {city}! It''s a wonderful place where [description]. Today''s
        weather is {weather}.\",\n  \"description\": \"{city} is famous for its magnificent
        {landmark}, where the wind whispers tales of adventure.\",\n  \"weather\":
        \"Currently, it''s a bit chilly with gentle breezes.\"\n}\n```\n\nNow, let''s
        see how you can use this template in conversation:\n\n**User:** I''m about
        to visit Wonderland. Can you give me an idea of what to expect?\n\n**Chat
        System (using the template):** \"Welcome to Wonderland! It''s a wonderful
        place where the wind whispers tales of adventure. Today, it''s a bit chilly
        with gentle breezes.\"\n\nThis shows how a template can dynamically incorporate
        placeholders for personalized content while providing context from a pre-defined
        structure. Do you have any other examples or topics in mind?","index":0,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":141,"completion_tokens":256,"total_tokens":397}}
