        famous question you're referring to is a tongue-twister and doesn't have an
        actual factual answer based on scientific research about the creature called
        a \\\"chuck.\\\" However, in popular culture, it's often humorously estimated
        to be around 700 pounds of wood. This number was apparently coined by Cliff
        Barwell in response to other participants' guesses during a radio contest
        in the late 1950s. Despite its lightning speed and chucking capabilities,
        this is purely an amusing figure used for entertainment rather than accurate
        biological data.\\n\\nFor real wood-chopping or gathering capacity of any
        animal, scientists measure it in terms of their weight per unit time\u2014like
        pounds of wood per hour or minute. For example, a lumberjack might be estimated
        to chop about 10 feet of wood with each stroke at a rate of one chop every
        five seconds.\",\"index\":0,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":112,\"completion_tokens\":208,\"total_tokens\":320}}\n"
