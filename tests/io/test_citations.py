Repos and Issue Tracking to share information is typical of many social coding \
platforms. However, such sharing might conflict with regulatory controls that \
apply to your business. After you create a project in Git Repos and Issue Tracking, \
but before you entrust any files, issues, records, or other data with the project, \
review the project settings and change any settings that you deem necessary to \
protect your data. Settings to review include visibility levels, email notifications, \
integrations, web hooks, access tokens, deploy tokens, and deploy keys. Project \
visibility levels \n\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking projects can have one of the \
following visibility levels: private, internal, or public. * Private projects are \

projects, and is the most secure visibility level for your data. * Internal projects \
are visible to all users that are logged in to IBM Cloud. * Public projects are \
