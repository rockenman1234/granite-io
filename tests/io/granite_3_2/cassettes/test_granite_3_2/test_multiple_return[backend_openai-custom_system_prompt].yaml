        money is nice, but it''s not like having candy every day. To help with this,
        we could play a fun game with numbers to make sure we have as much money as
        possible after giving some away each time we get dividends:\n\n1. **Grown-up
        friends say to keep record**: Let''s write down how many pieces of income
        we get from our toy boxes (dividends). Then, remember which ones are the biggest,
        because those let us know when we can share more or save it for special treats
        later.\n\n2. **Save small pieces for later**: Some grown-ups say good things
        happen if we set aside some little bits of income in a special piggy bank
        (tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s). That way, when we want to buy really
        big or fancy things in the future, we have extra money.\n\n3. **Charity for
        bigger pieces**: If there''s an animal shelter nearby that we like a lot,
        some grown-ups let us give away the bigger pieces. This can lower how much
        tax they get from our leftover toys (dividends). It makes them feel good when
        you help others too!\n\n4. **Ask smart friends for advice**: We might talk
        with teachers or people at a tax club for grown-ups who are really good at
        guessing which gifts (investments) should pay less in taxes and need which
        bank accounts (accounts). They can help us get the most playtime (money) for
        our toys.\n\nRemember, no matter how many dividends we find, always keep good
        records so tax-time won''t seem scary or tricky! Isn''t life fun with money
        puzzles like this?","index":0,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":84,"completion_tokens":377,"total_tokens":461}}
