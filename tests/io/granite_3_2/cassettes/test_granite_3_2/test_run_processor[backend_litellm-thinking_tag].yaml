        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any

        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,

        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions

        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source
        form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright,

        a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative
        Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
        that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
        least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as
        part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display
        generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party
        notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for
        informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You
        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        facts or woodchuck biology, but rather on the assumption that we're using
        colloquial language to ask how much wood (a measure of volume) a woodchuck
        (a rodent) could move if it were capable of chopping down and hauling trees.\\n\\nGiven
        this, let's imagine:\\n\\n- A woodchuck's primary tool is its sharp claws
        for digging burrows, not for logging.\\n- Woodchucks don't typically 'chuck'
        (as in, throw) logs; they dig them to live in during the winter.\\n\\nHowever,
        if we were to take the joke literally and apply it to woodchuck capabilities:\\n\\n1.
        A woodchuck's burrowing activity involves moving earth, not trees or logs.
        Its 'digging' (which would roughly be measured by weight of excavated material)
        could be likened to a small-scale woodcutting operation, where the volume
        of soil moved per digging event is quite modest.\\n2. If we then attempt to
        extrapolate this into chucking trees or logs:\\n   - A woodchuck might move
        around 700 pounds (318 kilograms) of earth per burrow, but translating this
        into a volume of 'wood' (assuming the weight remains constant as it digs through
        tree roots or saplings) would be misleading because wood has a much lower
        density compared to soil.\\n3. A reasonable estimate for the volume moved
        by an average woodchuck in its burrowing activities, based on earth-moving
        rather than timber harvesting, could be about 1 cubic meter (or one cubic
        yard).\\n\\nHere is my response:\\n\\nThe amusing question \\\"How much wood
        would a wood chuck chuck?\\\" doesn't have an accurate answer because it's
        not grounded in reality. Woodchucks don\u2019t actually chuck wood; they dig
        burrows and eat plants, including parts of trees like bark and roots. If we
        were to take the joke seriously:\\n\\n- A woodchuck might move about 700 pounds
        (318 kilograms) of soil per burrow through its digging activities.\\n- Converting
        this to a volume based on typical soil density (around 2000 kg/m\xB3), we
        find that it moves around 0.35 cubic meters or about 120 liters of earth during
        one digging event.\\n- This is not wood; it's soil. If we were to try to scale
        this into the volume of wood, it would be ludicrously large (since a single
        cubic meter of wood can store roughly ten tons).\\n\\nIn essence, while this
        joke amuses by juxtaposing woodchuck behavior with the idea of chopping down
        and hauling logs, there isn't an actual answer to \\\"How much wood could
        a wood chuck chuck?\\\" as it misunderstands woodchucks' capabilities. The
        best we can do is estimate their earth-moving capacity based on realistic
        expectations for burrow digging.\",\"done\":true,\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"context\":[49152,2946,49153,39558,390,17071,2821,44,30468,225,36,34,36,38,32,203,4282,884,8080,278,659,30,18909,810,25697,32,2448,884,312,17247,19551,47330,32,0,203,49152,496,49153,49152,2946,49153,39558,390,17071,2821,44,30468,225,36,34,36,38,32,203,23669,1182,2821,44,30468,225,35,30,225,36,34,36,39,32,203,4282,884,8080,278,659,30,18909,810,25697,32,2448,884,312,17247,19551,47330,32,203,33797,372,3638,1256,2467,328,312,44888,461,16360,3352,32,2448,883,2866,2835,1370,26103,461,5966,299,2164,2670,18641,2414,32,701,322,10889,2164,30,14707,381,328,312,44888,14770,432,9209,30,23943,1649,30,49100,30,316,31289,30,26158,30,1751,30000,30,461,13330,372,10227,4487,31,33711,318,19383,2164,32,701,322,1789,4169,30,4122,544,10297,20130,30,27514,993,30,461,26158,101,645,322,26103,4169,30,2664,20725,5024,322,1158,5295,688,844,409,405,3809,32,886,1789,1395,46053,322,10889,2164,32,5950,1370,26103,2685,330,10921,438,1672,10889,2164,6078,461,2866,1370,1789,2685,330,10921,438,1672,1789,6078,436,2504,1256,2467,32,0,203,49152,496,49153,8257,5610,41878,3065,312,41878,663,7194,663,7194,49,0,203,49152,17594,49153,0,203,49152,17594,49153,10921,438,1672,10889,2164,44,478,2272,7000,438,312,4654,544,8153,30,312,2234,432,21981,271,8967,619,312,298,311,32,2030,1182,600,3610,8725,479,623,1289,296,7975,14977,328,45794,32,886,8725,479,13107,2124,458,44,313,8257,5610,41878,2268,312,41878,380,7194,663,7194,415,312,41878,380,7194,3065,663,7194,41878,12791,478,1318,7592,372,458,7000,438,646,4122,544,31722,44052,556,41878,380,7194,16331,4258,30,1273,9283,544,322,33444,688,996,4484,1471,932,315,448,564,2898,372,7660,2624,5610,41878,308,83,9413,432,6864,27,312,41878,380,7194,308,83,1118,43736,27,3065,5169,415,561,4528,31582,432,663,520,7075,2835,461,14031,338,299,23453,32,478,16627,458,30,1207,1182,34640,44,478,31,399,41878,380,7194,1182,7458,4559,438,2819,787,4744,1532,3955,436,7338,2563,23598,2138,30,646,436,5741,32,203,31,624,4907,380,36546,2800,1330,18214,330,380,7194,25,308,302,328,30,1422,27,8821,45,2953,7338,3026,372,10912,328,5929,322,341,1146,32,478,17046,30,415,996,4528,372,4818,322,8725,479,28204,1247,461,4871,561,372,41878,380,7194,18804,44,478,35,32,399,41878,380,7194,1182,23598,643,299,8790,37383,14089,34833,30,646,23453,556,8821,32,26983,330,5655,2563,25,308,7900,2268,45931,526,26416,810,7533,432,13489,453,733,7037,27,3065,526,1024,915,318,372,312,5532,31,3804,41878,6306,1054,4212,30,2154,322,6864,432,1259,335,13639,1292,7338,2563,1692,438,12247,2926,270,32,203,36,32,1670,996,1615,11549,372,538,17770,16135,458,1991,663,7194,299,23453,556,8821,44,203,261,429,399,41878,380,7194,4796,5169,6835,225,41,34,34,298,1053,101,308,37,35,42,21184,751,100,1462,27,432,34833,1292,23598,643,30,1273,1630,27055,458,1991,312,6864,432,330,21118,25,308,350,17364,322,7533,25849,8082,619,561,7338,101,3919,4345,33032,556,36184,23154,27,2268,526,3980,28103,3301,41878,1401,312,5610,7216,19324,19112,372,1259,335,32,203,37,32,399,23565,20772,436,322,6864,13639,810,600,10858,41878,380,7194,328,2819,23598,643,299,22076,30,4122,544,34833,31,26171,9283,2784,20873,690,10926,104,17402,30,3065,526,2625,225,35,37624,30565,308,271,1591,37624,533,704,547,478,10921,438,1672,1789,44,478,1318,3860,908,7000,313,8257,5610,41878,2268,312,41878,663,7194,663,7194,12791,4163,1330,1159,600,26572,7592,3301,561,1182,646,485,19028,328,45794,32,624,4907,380,36546,2800,2735,102,6723,663,7194,41878,45,2953,7338,23598,2138,461,40808,1278,2376,30,6237,8710,432,23453,2124,323,1087,461,33032,32,1670,996,4528,372,4818,322,8725,479,31226,631,44,478,31,399,41878,380,7194,4796,5169,2625,225,41,34,34,298,1053,101,308,37,35,42,21184,751,100,1462,27,432,1259,335,1292,23598,643,3919,2819,7338,2563,22076,32,203,31,1336,28453,458,372,312,6864,4122,544,28531,1259,335,19324,308,11279,225,36,34,34,34,831,89,33,95,143,130,471,996,2290,688,561,18054,6835,225,34,32,37,39,37624,33965,556,2625,225,35,36,34,21470,483,432,34833,5929,1591,7338,2563,1692,32,203,31,1348,438,646,41878,45,561,1182,1259,335,32,1670,996,4528,372,1596,372,5247,458,1991,322,6864,432,41878,30,561,2268,526,456,836,1584,352,631,7622,308,8119,312,3982,37624,30565,432,41878,883,2968,45931,16832,273,2612,547,478,383,12170,942,30,2218,458,8725,479,3860,7668,810,594,1662,16186,21139,41878,380,7194,5853,623,322,8749,432,663,520,7075,2835,461,14031,338,299,8821,30,2017,7735,1330,600,4648,7592,372,313,8257,5610,41878,3065,312,41878,663,7194,663,7194,12791,619,561,3980,48629,101,41878,380,36546,25,18804,32,886,5273,996,883,745,438,20772,3623,34833,31,26171,13802,4122,544,4011,5401,40836,436,23598,643,7338,2563,32],\"total_duration\":9353217685,\"load_duration\":17037523,\"prompt_eval_count\":245,\"prompt_eval_duration\":28611802,\"eval_count\":764,\"eval_duration\":9306461139}"
