        much wood a woodchuck would chuck\" is a tongue twister based on fact and
        an old joke. According to a popular New England folktale, it is said that
        a \"woodchuck would chuck as much as 700 pounds of forest in one dig,\" or
        so the story goes. However, this figure is disputed by scientific research
        that suggests woodchucks (also known as groundhogs) actually push out about
        40-70 pounds of soil during a single \"chuck.\" Despite variations in these
        figures, they still provide an interesting comparison!\n\nSo, approximately
        40 to 70 pounds would be the range for how much wood, or rather dirt, a woodchuck
        could manage to move at one time.","index":0,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":112,"completion_tokens":177,"total_tokens":289}}
