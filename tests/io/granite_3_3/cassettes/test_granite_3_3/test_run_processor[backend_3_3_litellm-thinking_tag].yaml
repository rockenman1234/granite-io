        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may
        add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction,
        or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works
        as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
        Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.
        Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above,
        nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate

        Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
        to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
        of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use
        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without
        limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that
        You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
        from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices

        in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
        law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES

        the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
        no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
        or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
        be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility
        of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
        redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or
        other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own
        behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty
        or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:

        wood is entirely nonsensical from both a biological and practical standpoint.\\n\\nWoodchucks
        are burrowing animals primarily known for digging complex burrows in the ground
        using their strong front paws. They are not equipped with any natural tools
        or physical capabilities to move significant amounts of wood, whether as an
        adult or even a juvenile. \\n\\nTo address this question literally and scientifically:\\n-
        A woodchuck would not have the means (claws and body structure) to \\\"chuck\\\"
        or throw substantial quantities of wood.\\n- Their diet consists primarily
        of grasses, forbs, fruits, roots, and insects. Wood is not a significant part
        of their diet.\\n- Even if we assume the question is tongue-in-cheek and seeking
        an imaginative or humorous response, any quantification of wood a woodchuck
        could chuck is purely hypothetical and nonsensical due to their physical limitations.\\n\\nIn
        essence, the phrase \\\"How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?\\\" is more
        of a playful saying rather than a serious scientific inquiry.\\u003c/think\\u003e\\u003cresponse\\u003e###
        The Woodchuck's Capability:\\nThe question \\\"How much wood could a woodchuck
        chuck?\\\" is a classic tongue twister with no factual basis. Here\u2019s
        the reasoning:\\n\\n1. **Biological Perspective**:\\n   - A woodchuck, or
        groundhog, is a burrowing mammal. They are well-adapted to digging underground
        tunnels and not for moving large amounts of wood. \\n   - Their paws lack
        the structure (like claws) needed to grasp and move substantial pieces of
        wood efficiently.\\n  \\n2. **Practical Considerations**:\\n   - Woodchucks
        primarily consume vegetation such as grasses, herbs, roots, and insects. Wood
        is not part of their diet or toolset. \\n   - There\u2019s no evidence that
        a woodchuck could physically handle or move enough wood to be meaningful.\\n\\n3.
        **Humorous Interpretation**:\\n   - While the question can be amusingly asked,
        any hypothetical calculation (e.g., assuming they could chuck based on their
        burrowing speed and efficiency) would yield results that are purely imaginative
        due to the impracticality of their biology.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nIn a literal
        sense, given the physical characteristics of woodchucks, they cannot \\\"chuck\\\"
        any meaningful amount of wood. The question is more of a whimsical tongue
        twister than a scientific inquiry with a concrete answer.\\u003c/response\\u003e\",\"done\":true,\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"context\":[49152,2946,49153,39558,390,17071,2821,44,30468,225,36,34,36,38,32,203,4282,884,8080,278,659,30,18909,810,25697,32,2448,884,312,17247,19551,47330,32,0,203,49152,496,49153,49152,2946,49153,39558,390,17071,2821,44,30468,225,36,34,36,38,32,203,23669,1182,2821,44,30468,225,35,30,225,36,34,36,39,32,203,4282,884,8080,278,659,30,18909,810,25697,32,2448,884,312,17247,19551,47330,32,203,33797,372,3638,1256,2467,328,312,44888,461,16360,3352,32,2448,883,2866,2835,1370,26103,461,5966,299,2164,2670,18641,2414,32,701,322,10889,2164,30,14707,381,328,312,44888,14770,432,9209,30,23943,1649,30,49100,30,316,31289,30,26158,30,1751,30000,30,461,13330,372,10227,4487,31,33711,318,19383,2164,32,701,322,1789,4169,30,4122,544,10297,20130,30,27514,993,30,461,26158,101,645,322,26103,4169,30,2664,20725,5024,322,1158,5295,688,844,409,405,3809,32,886,1789,1395,46053,322,10889,2164,32,5950,1370,26103,3733,333,16462,855,16462,48,461,2866,1370,1789,3733,333,1986,855,1986,48,436,2504,1256,2467,32,0,203,49152,496,49153,8257,5610,41878,3065,312,41878,663,7194,663,7194,49,0,203,49152,17594,49153,0,203,49152,17594,49153,46,16462,48,1318,23909,313,8257,5610,41878,3065,312,41878,380,7194,663,7194,20,438,312,23068,273,788,340,8206,19240,461,12270,1654,619,312,8725,479,30,9283,2784,312,31226,328,32885,1991,7361,278,1578,556,1288,604,11081,44052,32,886,5615,313,21118,380,7194,2360,2329,8967,619,312,16398,44770,30,438,6723,312,345,404,7904,688,736,12804,328,27957,29334,30,1273,2819,13609,372,663,7194,41878,438,22804,310,2612,1229,1578,645,4335,312,16331,11081,461,37417,14019,1493,32,203,203,73,4907,380,36546,884,23598,643,299,26261,101,37897,8967,436,7338,2563,8640,23598,2138,328,322,16398,1471,3623,12101,8432,298,3955,32,11228,884,646,15588,9974,623,1346,19844,8684,556,14303,18804,372,5169,14724,31651,432,41878,30,4946,619,600,1544,455,556,4444,312,34699,2465,414,32,1659,203,705,2965,458,7000,28204,1247,461,31722,1247,44,203,31,399,41878,380,7194,2268,646,1159,322,6058,308,573,3955,461,3361,5193,27,372,313,380,7194,20,556,1422,14226,13292,2105,432,41878,32,203,31,886,476,2068,364,21852,37897,432,2914,2515,30,436,3883,30,35436,1507,30,33032,30,461,328,6764,101,32,624,4907,438,646,312,14724,1742,432,3623,2068,364,32,203,31,21984,415,996,10014,322,7000,438,273,788,340,31,266,31,1058,3748,461,2318,12897,600,17463,266,1353,556,21981,271,3291,1789,30,1346,13292,1865,432,41878,312,41878,380,7194,3065,663,7194,438,12463,631,420,19107,10264,1578,461,310,2612,1229,1578,7254,372,3623,14303,5183,32,203,203,383,12170,942,30,322,23909,313,8257,5610,41878,3065,312,41878,380,7194,663,7194,12791,438,1829,432,312,4654,2790,23060,9283,2784,312,31226,31722,328,32885,1730,16462,772,1986,48,1482,886,624,4907,380,7194,1182,16674,3452,44,203,1318,7000,313,8257,5610,41878,3065,312,41878,380,7194,663,7194,12791,438,312,39115,273,788,340,8206,19240,623,1289,296,7975,14977,32,9540,2735,101,322,5966,299,44,478,35,32,1115,19558,11081,17374,16534,4914,664,429,399,41878,380,7194,30,556,16398,44770,30,438,312,23598,643,299,345,404,7904,32,11228,884,4487,31,19647,318,372,7338,2563,1531,1749,29403,101,461,646,436,14089,7622,31651,432,41878,32,9068,429,886,476,298,3955,21671,322,5193,308,6228,1532,3955,27,5349,372,2914,11797,461,5169,14226,23073,432,41878,42990,32,31127,36,32,1115,31503,1578,23527,993,4914,664,429,624,4907,380,36546,37897,16831,5292,371,367,3751,619,2914,2515,30,7791,3883,30,33032,30,461,328,6764,101,32,624,4907,438,646,1742,432,3623,2068,364,556,4559,470,32,9068,429,5802,2735,101,1289,28028,688,312,41878,380,7194,3065,26571,7637,2887,556,5169,8448,41878,372,526,33081,32,478,37,32,1115,31213,271,3291,4803,44151,4914,664,429,16141,322,7000,883,526,3860,908,631,18480,30,1346,420,19107,10264,1578,17686,308,87,32,89,4317,26933,2953,3065,663,7194,4122,544,3623,23598,643,299,8227,461,30714,27,2268,6761,3276,688,884,12463,631,17463,266,1353,7254,372,322,1360,100,536,1578,543,432,3623,16331,4258,32,203,203,1482,1336,13715,44,203,383,312,10652,10568,30,2702,322,14303,32719,432,41878,380,36546,30,2953,4881,313,380,7194,20,1346,33081,5168,432,41878,32,886,7000,438,1829,432,312,640,16150,1578,273,788,340,8206,19240,2784,312,31722,328,32885,623,312,26322,7592,1730,1986,48],\"total_duration\":4824409817,\"load_duration\":15906169,\"prompt_eval_count\":242,\"prompt_eval_duration\":18076261,\"eval_count\":668,\"eval_duration\":4789291719}"
