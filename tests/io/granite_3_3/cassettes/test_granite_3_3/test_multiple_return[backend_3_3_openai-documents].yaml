        sorry for any confusion, but this document only mentions \"thesaurus\" in
        passing. It doesn''t provide a direct synonym or alternative for it. However,
        a thesaurus is a reference work that lists words showing their origins, definitions,
        and sometimes cognates, often used to expand vocabulary by offering variations
        of meaning \u003c|start_of_cite|\u003e{\"document_id\": \"1\"}\u003c|end_of_cite|\u003e.
        To find an alternative word, one might consider using a different type of
        dictionary or lexicon.","index":0,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":217,"completion_tokens":101,"total_tokens":318}}
